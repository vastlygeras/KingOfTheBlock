# KingOfTheBlock
King of the Block is an online casino with its own ERC20 token called King Ether. 

Liquidity providers exchange their Ether for King Ether. The value of King Ether grows proportionally to the growth of the casino's funds. Liquidity providers may sell their King Ether back to the casino at any time.

The casino employs a simple system to add/remove new blockchain games via a call to the smart contract made by the casino owner. The ownership of the casino is currently centralized, but can be entrusted to a DAO as the development of the casino continues.

This showcase project includes a simple game connected to the casino to demonstrate its capabilities, alongside the project.
